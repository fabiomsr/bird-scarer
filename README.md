# Bird Scarer

Bird Scarer is an electronic bird scare project that uses an ESP32 to generate sounds and flashing lights to deter unwanted birds in gardens, crops, or other areas.

## Features

- Utilizes an ESP32 as the main controller.
- Generates random sounds and flashing lights to create a sense of danger for the birds.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Bird Scarer project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Connect the necessary hardware components as specified in the documentation.
4. Upload the firmware to the ESP32 board.

## Requirements

To fully implement the Bird Scarer project, you will need the following components:

- ESP32 development board
- Amplifier module
- Speaker or loudspeaker
- Power supply (e.g., battery or power adapter)

The amplifier module and speaker are necessary to effectively generate and amplify the sound output produced by the ESP32. The sound signals generated by the ESP32 will be passed through the amplifier, which will boost the audio signals, and then played through the speaker to create audible scare sounds.

You can choose an amplifier module and speaker that suit your specific requirements in terms of audio quality, volume, and power output. Make sure to properly connect and configure the amplifier and speaker according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Note: The exact specifications and wiring details for the amplifier and speaker may vary depending on the specific hardware components you choose. Refer to the documentation and specifications of the amplifier and speaker modules for accurate wiring and setup instructions.
